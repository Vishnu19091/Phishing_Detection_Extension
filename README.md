# Introduction

### **What is Phishing & Anti-Phishing ?**

<div style="width:85%;">

- **Phishing** refers to the fraudulent practice of sending fake messages or creating deceptive websites that mimic legitimate ones to lure users into disclosing sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details.

- **Anti-Phishing** refers to the measures and technologies designed to detect and prevent phishing attacks, which are deceptive attempts to steal sensitive information like passwords, credit card details, or personal data.

<div >

This work presents a **real-time phishing detection system** that integrates machine learning models to effectively identify and prevent phishing attacks, spam, and defaced websites. The system is **designed to analyze various key URL features such as length, domain, subdomain, numeric characters, special characters, and the presence of HTTPS, providing a comprehensive approach to phishing detection.**

Also the system will be used as browser extension with some features like: **total no.of scan, no.of phishing websites detected and authenticated users will allowed to report spam websites manually.**
