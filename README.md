## What is Phishing & Anti-Phishing ?

**Phishing** refers to the fraudulent practice of sending fake messages or creating deceptive websites that mimic legitimate ones to lure users into disclosing sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details. These attacks not only compromise individuals' privacy and finances but also threaten the security of organizations and societies at large.

**Anti-Phishing** refers to the measures and technologies designed to detect and prevent phishing attacks, which are deceptive attempts to steal sensitive information like passwords, credit card details, or personal data. These measures include tools like machine learning models, browser extensions, email filters, and real-time URL scanners that analyze features such as domain authenticity, URL structure, and email content to identify phishing attempts.
