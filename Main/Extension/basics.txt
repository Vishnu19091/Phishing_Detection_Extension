<-------- Content scripts -------->
RUNS IN A WEB PAGE

A content script is a part of your extension that
runs in the context of a web page. It can read and
modify page content using the standard Web APIs.
Content script behavior is similar to scripts that
are part of a website, such as those loaded using the
<script> element). However, content scripts can only
access page content when host permissions for the web
page's origin are granted.

Content scripts can access a small subset of the
WebExtension APIs, but they can communicate with
background scripts using a messaging system and
thereby indirectly access the WebExtension APIs.
Background scripts can access all the WebExtension
JavaScript APIs but can't directly access the content of web pages.

<-------- Background Scripts -------->
Background scripts or a background page enable
you to monitor and react to events in the browser,
such as navigating to a new page, removing a bookmark,
or closing a tab.

Background scripts or a page are:

    Persistent – loaded when the extension starts and
        unloaded when the extension is disabled or uninstalled.

    Non-persistent (which are also known as event pages) –
    loaded only when needed to respond to an event and unloaded
    when they become idle. However, a background page does not
    unload until all visible views and message ports are closed.
    Opening a view does not cause the background page to load
    but does prevent it from closing.
